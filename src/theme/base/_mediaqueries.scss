  MEDIAQUERIES
  
  We should follow mobile-first methodology. It means that our default styles will be applied since the lowest resolutions.
  We should start always giving scss with the mobile resolution and once they are finished, expand our device simulator to tablet and so on.
  Doing this, we will prevent writting lots of lines of code and extra mediaqueries that are not needed.
  
  
  # Definition
  -----------------------
  @mixin respond-to takes an argument to apply styles to that resolution and wider:
    - tablet
    - desktop

  # Usage:
  -----------------------
  .header {
    height: 50px;
    @include respond-to(tablet){
      height: 40px // This will overide the height in tablet and wider screen sizes
    }

    @include respond-to(desktop){
      height: 30px // This will overide the height in desktop and wider screen sizes
      color: red;
    }

    @include respond-to(ultrawide){
      height: 30px // This will overide the height in desktop and wider screen sizes
      max-width: 50px;
    }
  }
