# List and ListItem components
## specific to profile

The goal is to have a list and li item component, this component is a bit opinionated specifically for a userâ€™s profile. The list li's are built to have 2 columns the first for the icon and the second for the text.
## Props

This takes the prop items: as Object or children


- `items: Object`
