# Buttons

Buttons are interactive elements designed to grab a users attention.  They are often used as a call to action (CTA) we want our users to take.  For example, navigating to another page, or completing a process like submitting a form.

## Props

- `skin: String`
    - Default to `primary`
    - Options: 
        - `primary` (default)
        - `secondary`
        - `danger`

## Primary Button

A primary button is the main CTA and is recommended to be used sparingly within a page.  In a perfect world only a single primary button would be shown in a section; this helps the users better understand the action they should take.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Primary">
        <Button>Primary</Button>
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Secondary Button

A secondary button represents actions that the user can take that are not part of the main flow.  For example, clearing a form or deleting an item from a shopping cart.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Secondary">
        <Button skin="secondary">Secondary</Button>
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Danger Button

Danger buttons help the user understand that clicking the button will result in an outcome that they should consider thoroughly before they proceed.  Deleting an account or leaving a form without submitting all the values are good examples of how a Danger button can be used.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Danger">
        <Button skin="danger">Danger</Button>
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Kitchen Sink example

Below is a "kitchen sink" example which is configured to allow the `controls` feature in the canvas.  Check it out to discover more about this component.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Kitchen Sink"
        args={{children:"Kitchen Sink"}}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
