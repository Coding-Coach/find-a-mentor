Thank you so much for your willing to help! We and the community appreciate you üññ

We're using (from certain point, at least) the following tools. Please make sure you're using them too.

## Typescript

[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3C%2F%3E-TypeScript-%230074c1.svg)](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)

We still have some `.js` files but please don't add more.
For files with JSX syntax, use `.tsx` files, otherwise, use `.ts`.

## Styled Components üíÖ

[![style: styled-components](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-%F0%9F%92%85%20styled--components-orange.svg?colorB=daa357&colorA=db748e)](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
We need to migrate some of the existing code.

Please don't use css in any other kind (global, css modules etc.)
Currently, we don't have common styled-components (components that can be used in more than one component).
If there is a case for this, consult us and we'll decide together.


## Storybook üìñ

[![storybook](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/storybookjs/brand@master/badge/badge-storybook.svg)](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/sb/)
 If you're creating a reusable component (like Card or Modal), please create a <a href="https://mentors.codingcoach.io/sb/" target="_blank" />storybook</a> for it.
We'll probably mention it in the issue.


## Tests üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We're using [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). The tests are not blocker but please, do your best.
