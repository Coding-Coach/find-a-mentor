## Want to be a mentor?

1. Fork
1. `yarn` (make sure you have a compatible node version, [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#installation) can help here)

### CLI Geek?

![Add user - demo](docs-assets/demo-add-user.gif)

1. `yarn run add-user`
1. Answer the questions.
1. Step 2 will push the required changes to a branch `add-{your-name}-as-mentor` so you just need to create a PR.

### Like to do it manually?
1. **Create a branch** "add-{your-name}-as-mentor"
1. Add your details in `src/mentors.json` file (check the below schema for requirements).
1. Run `yarn test` to validate that the details is following the right schema (carelfully read the output to see what needs to be fixed)
1. Push the "add-{your-name}-as-mentor" branch to github
1. PR with the title "Add {Your Name} as mentor".
1. Thanks!

**Notes:**

1. Please double check your details. Itâ€™s important that the data scheme remains the same; just replace the details with your values. If you change the data architecture, it will cause errors.
2. In order to avoid merge conflicts, please fetch the changes on master before pushing.
